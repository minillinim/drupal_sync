DESCRIPTION:

A set of scripts which can be used to sync dev and production versions of a drupal website.

Only tested with drupal 6 but this doesn't make any use of drupal api's so technically it should work with any version of drupal...
   ...perhaps even with different web technologies?

To make this system work you will need to do the following:

1. Make a siterc file. Follow the format of example.siterc
2. Make getSite.sh and sendSite.sh scripts. Again follow the examples
3. chmod 400 your siterc file and place it in the $dev_bin_dir
4. To pull an exact duplicate of your production site down onto your dev machine run getSite.sh
5. Add pushDrupal.sh, pullDrupal.sh backup_drupal.sh and restore_drupal.sh to your path
6. To push a modified version of your dev site onto the production server run sendSite.sh

Enjoi!
